<p><span id="ctl00_ctl00_Content_TabContentPanel_Content_wikiSourceLabel">The 
example shows how to integrate C# and Python using the new dynamic 
feature found in C# 4.0. To run the sample, you will need to install
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15625">
IronPython 2.0</a>, which is a available as a separate download. It may also 
work with more recent versions of IronPython. After installing IronPython you 
will need to update this sample by replacing the
<strong>IronPython</strong>, <strong>IronPython.Modules,</strong> <strong>
Microsoft.Scripting</strong>, and <strong>
Microsoft.Scripting.Core</strong> assemblies found in the References section. Open 
the Solution Explorer and right click on the <strong>References</strong> node. 
Remove the assemblies listed earlier in this paragraph. Choose <strong>Add Reference</strong>. Browse to the directory where you 
installed IronPython and add the deleted assemblies. By 
default, IronPython is installed in the <strong>Program Files</strong> directory, so you should 
be able to find the assemblies there. After you have updated your References 
section, the program should compile and run without error.</span></p>
